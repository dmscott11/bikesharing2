# Bikesharing
## Overview
In an effort to grow the CitiBike franchise, an expansion into Des Moines, Iowa has been planned. To successfully implement this new division in CitiBike, it is important to understand who our target demographic is, and how best to maintain our assets (the citibikes). The majority of this analysis focuses on identifying the trips, times, and users that often utilize these citibikes. 
## Results
### User Trips by Gender
### Trips by Weekday (Per Hour)
### Trips by Gender
### Checkout Times by Users
### Checkout Times by Gender
### Peak Hours
### Bikes Needing Repairs
## Summary
Overall, it can be seen that our target demographic should be males as they are significantly more likely to utilize CitiBike services. This focus can occur by using targeted advertisements which could be found in predominately male areas (i.e. sporting venues). Additionally, the maintenance of citibikes is crucial so we identified a method to identify which bikes see the most useage, and when maintenance should occur on those bikes. This maintenance will not impact the availability of citibikes as it will occur during off peak-hours. 
### Suggested Visualizations
- Heatmap for Des Moines indicating which areas see the most foot traffic. These areas will also likely see a greater use of citibikes. 
- If possible, it would also be useful to see how much of the citibike traffic in Manhatten is due to tourism. Having users registers as "tourists" or "locals" could help provide more insight into daily use. Using this data we would create a chart with tourism filtered out of it to allow for a greater understanding.
