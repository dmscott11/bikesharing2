## Overview
In an effort to grow the CitiBike franchise, an expansion into Des Moines, Iowa has been planned. To successfully implement this new division in CitiBike, it is important to understand who our target demographic is, and how best to maintain our assets (the citibikes). The majority of this analysis focuses on identifying the trips, times, and users that often utilize these citibikes. The [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/Citibike_Challenge2/MarketingStrategyandUpkeep?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) file is available for viewing. From the tableau story, you can see that our primary focus is identifying a key demographic that we should focus on. In this instance, that demographic is the male users, as they make up a substantial portion of our user base. 
## Results
### User Trips by Gender
The below chart reinforces the idea that our primary focus should be selling citibike services to male users.

### Trips by Weekday (Per Hour)
The keytimes for trips during the week are what you would expect. Both before, and after work. This leads us to the conclusion that these are not optimal times for maintenance and that the bikes themselves should be placed in foot traffic heavy areas.

### Trips by Gender
This chart reinforces the above information. That males (our primary focus) are the main users of citibikes during those two time periods, both from 8-10 am and 5-7pm.

## Summary
Overall, it can be seen that our target demographic should be males as they are significantly more likely to utilize CitiBike services. This focus can occur by using targeted advertisements which could be found in predominately male areas (i.e. sporting venues). Additionally, the maintenance of citibikes is crucial so we identified a method to identify which bikes see the most useage, and when maintenance should occur on those bikes. This maintenance will not impact the availability of citibikes as it will occur during off peak-hours. 
### Suggested Visualizations
- Heatmap for Des Moines indicating which areas see the most foot traffic. These areas will also likely see a greater use of citibikes. 
- If possible, it would also be useful to see how much of the citibike traffic in Manhatten is due to tourism. Having users registers as "tourists" or "locals" could help provide more insight into daily use. Using this data we would create a chart with tourism filtered out of it to allow for a greater understanding.
